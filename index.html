  <h1>Starcraft 2 Bank Rebuilder</h1>
  <p>This tool extracts bankfiles from a replay,
    then serves them up for you to download</p>
  <p>If you are interested in learning about how the page was made, check out the

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <p>Replays are typically found in Documents/StarCraft II/Accounts/{###}/{playerID}/Replays</p>
  <p>Upload the replay (.sc2replay) for processing</p>
  <input type="file" id="file-input" accept=".sc2replay" />
  <p>Generated output files will appear below, with
    the playerID followed by the name of the bankfile
  </p>
  <pre id="output"></pre>
  <pre id="gameID"></pre>
  <ul id="file-list"></ul>
  <p>Once you get your bank, you will want to place it in the specific
    game's folder; Documents/StarCraft II/Accounts/{###}/{playerID}/Banks/{gameID}<br>
    To help with this, the gameID will be displayed by this tool.
